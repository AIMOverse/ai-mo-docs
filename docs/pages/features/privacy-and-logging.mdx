# Privacy, Logging, and Data Collection

## Within AiMo Network

AiMo Network do not store your prompts or responses, unless you have explicitly opted in to prompt logging in your account settings. It's as simple as that.

:::info
AiMo Network currently runs on node servers operated by AiMo Labs, ensuring the highest level of security and reliability (see our [privacy policy](https://aimo.network/privacy-policy) and [terms of service](https://aimo.network/terms-of-service)). Future plans include decentralizing node operations, with security and reliability enforced through on-chain consensus.
:::

AiMo Network do store metadata (e.g. number of prompt and completion tokens, latency, etc) for each request. This is used to power our reporting and model ranking, and your activity feed.

## Provider Policies

Due to the permissionless nature of AiMo Network, we assume providers may log, store, and train on your data by default unless they voluntarily complete KYC and disclose their data handling and retention policies.

:::info
**Data Policies Filtering** feature is currently in development. Once available, you will be able to filter providers based on their data handling and retention policies.
