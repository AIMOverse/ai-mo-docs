## Rate Limits and Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use Streaming**: Enable streaming for better user experience
2. **Batch Requests**: Group multiple requests when possible
3. **Cache Responses**: Cache responses for repeated queries
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track token usage to optimize costs

### Fair Usage

1. **Respect Rate Limits**: Don't exceed provider-specific rate limits
2. **Optimize Prompts**: Use efficient prompts to reduce token costs
3. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
