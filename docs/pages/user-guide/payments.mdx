# Payment and Billing

## Set Up Your Account Balance

To use model services, you need to top up your escrow account with tokens:

### Using the CLI

1. **Get the Service Token**: Contact your AiMo Network node operator for the token mint address
2. **Top Up Your Escrow**: You'll need to deposit tokens into your escrow account managed by the router

### Using the Dashboard

You can also top up your account balance directly through our web dashboard, which provides a user-friendly interface for account management.

The escrow system ensures secure, automated payments for model usage without requiring manual approval for each request.

## How Payments Work

1. **Escrow Account**: Your tokens are held in a secure escrow account
2. **Pre-Authorization**: Before each request, the system estimates and locks the maximum cost
3. **Actual Settlement**: After the request completes, you're charged only for actual usage
4. **Automatic Recovery**: If a request fails, locked tokens are automatically recovered

## Usage Tracking

Payments are calculated based on:

- **Token Usage**: Input tokens (prompt) and output tokens (completion)
- **Provider Pricing**: Each provider sets their own pricing per token
- **Model Type**: Different models may have different pricing

## Managing Your Balance

- **Check Balance**: Monitor your escrow balance through your wallet or node operator tools
- **Top Up**: Add more tokens to your escrow account when needed
- **Withdraw**: Unused tokens can be withdrawn from your escrow account
