# Payment and Billing

<Callout type="warning">
The payment program currently runs only on devnet internally. When you top up your account, you transfer USDC to our system, which records the transaction and performs the onchain top-up internally on devnet. Payment settlement also runs on devnet. 

We transfer providers' earnings to them whenever they request it through our system, based on devnet results and database records. We plan to migrate to mainnet in Q4 2025, after which centralized transactions will no longer be needed.

## Set Up Your Account Balance

To use model services, you need to top up your escrow account with USDC:

### Using the Dashboard

Currently, the only supported method for topping up your account is through the web dashboard:

1. **Visit the dashboard**: Go to [web dashboard](https://aimo.network/account/balance)
2. **Top up your account**: Add USDC to your escrow balance using the user-friendly dashboard interface
3. **Monitor your balance**: Track your account balance and usage through the dashboard

## How Payments Work

1. **Escrow Account**: Your tokens are held in a secure escrow account
2. **Pre-Authorization**: Before each request, the system estimates and locks the maximum cost
3. **Actual Settlement**: After the request completes, you're charged only for actual usage
4. **Automatic Recovery**: If a request fails, locked tokens are automatically recovered

## Usage Tracking

Payments are calculated based on:

- **Token Usage**: Input tokens (prompt) and output tokens (completion)
- **Provider Pricing**: Each provider sets their own pricing per token
- **Model Type**: Different models may have different pricing

## Managing Your Balance

- **Check Balance**: Monitor your escrow balance through your wallet or node operator tools
- **Top Up**: Add more tokens to your escrow account when needed
- **Withdraw**: Unused tokens can be withdrawn from your escrow account
