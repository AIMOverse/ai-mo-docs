## General Questions

### What is AiMo Network?

AiMo Network is a decentralized Intelligence Marketplace that provides a permissionless and unifies API to access models, mcp servers, and other bulding block of AI agents from various service providers.

### How is AiMo Network different from OpenRouter?

- **Permissionless Access**: Anyone can join as a user or service provider, regardless of identity, location, or affiliation, and participate freely in the marketplace without gatekeeping or approval processes. Our roadmap includes a fully permissionless router network, enabling anyone to operate routing infrastructure and earn rewards for providing network services.

- **Competitive Token Pricing**: Unlike OpenRouter, which charges 5% markup on token prices (8% for crypto payments), AiMo Network only applies a 3% markup on stablecoin payments. Users pay directly for tokens consumed, ensuring fair compensation for providers while maintaining transparent, low-cost access.

- **Agent-Native Infrastructure**: AiMo Network is purpose-built for AI agents, providing native compatibility as foundational infrastructure for autonomous AI systems. Our expanding ecosystem will include MCP servers, context management, and comprehensive AI agent building blocksâ€”creating a complete platform for intelligent automation.

### What types of models are available?

We support a wide range of AI model types including LLMs, image generation, code generation, embedding, and multimodal models. Our permissionless marketplace enables unique access to model categories that traditional providers often restrict:

**1. Open-Source Models**: Community-driven models like Llama, Mistral, CodeLlama, and Qwen that anyone can host and serve, fostering innovation and competition.

**2. Uncensored Models**: Unfiltered versions of popular models including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini, allowing unrestricted use cases without content moderation barriers.

**3. Edge Computing Models**: Lightweight models optimized for edge deployment, such as Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Phi-3-Mini, enabling low-latency local inference.

**4. Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: Custom-trained and privately-hosted models on user-controlled infrastructure, ensuring complete data sovereignty and specialized model capabilities.

## Technical Questions

### Are you compatible with OpenAI API?

Yes, many of our endpoints are OpenAI-compatible, making it easy to switch existing applications to AiMo Network with minimal code changes.

### How do you ensure high availability?

We use multiple strategies:
- Multiple providers for popular models
- Automatic failover and retry logic
- Global load balancing
- 99.9% uptime SLA

## Billing & Payments

### How does billing work?

- **Pay-per-use**: You're only charged for successful requests
- **Real-time billing**: Usage is tracked and billed immediately
- **Transparent pricing**: No hidden fees or markup
- **Detailed reporting**: View usage and costs in your dashboard

### What payment methods do you accept?

Right now, we only support USDC stablecoin on Solana for payments. 

### Can I get a refund?

## Security & Privacy

### How do you protect my data?

We, as the router network, do not store any data from the requests. However, the providers can store the data if they want to.

### Who can see my API requests?

For now by default, only you and providerscan see your requests. 


## Provider Questions

### Can I become a model provider?

Yes! We're always looking for new providers. See our [Provider Guide](/provider-guide) for details on how to join our network.

### How much can I earn as a provider?

Earnings vary based on model popularity, pricing, and performance. Top providers earn thousands of dollars per month. See [Pricing & Rewards](/provider-guide/pricing) for details. For top-rating providers, we will provide additional incentives.
