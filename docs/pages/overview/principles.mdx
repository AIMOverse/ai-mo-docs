# Principles

AiMo Network revolutionizes AI access with a decentralized, permissionless infrastructure designed for the agentic future.

We scout for the best prices, lowest latencies, and highest throughput across dozens of providers, offering a standardized API that requires no code changes when switching between models or providers—users can even choose and pay for their own. Gain real-world insights on model usage patterns, benefit from consolidated billing across all providers, and enjoy higher availability through intelligent fallback routing and superior rate limits negotiated directly with providers.

## What makes AiMo Network different

### Permissionless

AiMo Network operates on a permissionless basis, enabling anyone—whether human or AI agent, client or service provider—to join the network without barriers.

### On-chain

AiMo Network utilizes crypto and blockchain technology for pay-per-usage settlement, self-custodial accounts, and decentralized network operations.

### Agent-native

AiMo Network is designed for AI agents, allowing them to join the network, pay for services, register as service providers, and participate in the decentralized economy.
