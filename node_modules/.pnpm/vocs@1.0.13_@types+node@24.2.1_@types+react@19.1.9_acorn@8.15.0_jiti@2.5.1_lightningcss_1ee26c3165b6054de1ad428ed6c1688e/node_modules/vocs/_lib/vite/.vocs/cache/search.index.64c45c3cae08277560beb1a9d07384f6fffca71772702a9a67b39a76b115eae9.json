"{\"value\":{\"mdx\":\"# FAQ\\n\\n## General Questions\\n\\n### What is AiMo Network?\\n\\nAiMo Network is a decentralized Intelligence Marketplace that provides a permissionless and unifies API to access models, mcp servers, and other bulding block of AI agents from various service providers.\\n\\n### How is AiMo Network different from OpenRouter?\\n\\n- **Permissionless Access**: Anyone can join as a user or service provider, regardless of identity, location, or affiliation, and participate freely in the marketplace without gatekeeping or approval processes. Our roadmap includes a fully permissionless router network, enabling anyone to operate routing infrastructure and earn rewards for providing network services.\\n\\n- **Competitive Token Pricing**: Unlike OpenRouter, which charges 5% markup on token prices (8% for crypto payments), AiMo Network only applies a 3% markup on stablecoin payments. Users pay directly for tokens consumed, ensuring fair compensation for providers while maintaining transparent, low-cost access.\\n\\n- **Agent-Native Infrastructure**: AiMo Network is purpose-built for AI agents, providing native compatibility as foundational infrastructure for autonomous AI systems. Our expanding ecosystem will include MCP servers, context management, and comprehensive AI agent building blocks—creating a complete platform for intelligent automation.\\n\\n### What types of models are available?\\n\\nWe support a wide range of AI model types including LLMs, image generation, code generation, embedding, and multimodal models. Our permissionless marketplace enables unique access to model categories that traditional providers often restrict:\\n\\n**1. Open-Source Models**: Community-driven models like Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2, Mistral 7B, Qwen2.5, and Phi-3 that anyone can host and serve, fostering innovation and competition.\\n\\n**2. Uncensored & Alternative Models**: Fine-tuned and alternative versions of popular architectures with reduced content filtering, including community models based on Llama, Mistral, and other open-source foundations that allow more flexible use cases.\\n\\n**3. Edge Computing Models**: Lightweight models optimized for edge deployment, such as Llama 3.2 1B/3B, Phi-3.5-Mini, and Qwen2.5 0.5B/1.5B, enabling low-latency local inference.\\n\\n**4. Self-Hosted Infrastructure**: Custom-trained and privately-hosted models on user-controlled infrastructure, ensuring complete data sovereignty and specialized model capabilities.\\n\\n## Technical Questions\\n\\n### Are you compatible with OpenAI API?\\n\\nYes, many of our endpoints are OpenAI-compatible, making it easy to switch existing applications to AiMo Network with minimal code changes.\\n\\n### How do you ensure high availability?\\n\\nWe use multiple strategies:\\n- Multiple providers for popular models\\n- Automatic failover and retry logic\\n- Global load balancing\\n- 99.9% uptime SLA\\n\\n## Billing & Payments\\n\\n### How does billing work?\\n\\n- **Pay-per-use**: You're only charged for successful requests\\n- **Real-time billing**: Usage is tracked and billed immediately\\n- **Transparent pricing**: No hidden fees or markup\\n- **Detailed reporting**: View usage and costs in your dashboard\\n\\n### What payment methods do you accept?\\n\\nRight now, we only support USDC stablecoin on Solana for payments. \\n\\n### Can I get a refund?\\n\\nDue to the nature of the platform, we do not offer refunds for most cases. However, if you have a valid reason, you can contact us at support@aimo.network.\\n\\n## Security & Privacy\\n\\n### How do you protect my data?\\n\\nWe, as the router network, do not store any data from the requests. However, the providers can store the data if they want to.\\n\\n### Who can see my API requests?\\n\\nFor now by default, only you and providerscan see your requests. \\n\\n\\n## Provider Questions\\n\\n### Can I become a model provider?\\n\\nYes! We're always looking for new providers. See our [Provider Guide](/provider-guide) for details on how to join our network.\\n\\n### How much can I earn as a provider?\\n\\nEarnings vary based on model popularity, pricing, and performance. Top providers earn thousands of dollars per month. See [Pricing & Rewards](/provider-guide/pricing) for details. For top-rating providers, we will provide additional incentives.\\n\\n## Support\\n\\n### How can I get help?\\n\\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and API reference\\n- **Community**: Join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MkeG9Zwuaw)\\n\\nStill have questions?
